AXIOM is a collection of projects related to custom designed computers.

## Architectures

### [AX08](https://github.com/VoxelPi/AX08)

A general purpose, 8-bit computer. Noteworthy features include:

- 8 general purpose register.
- 16 bit address space
- 27 different instructions, the documentation for which can be found [here](./AX08/instruction_set.md).
- Each instruction can be conditionally executed.
- 2 IO Ports.
- A clock speed of up to 20k instructions per second.

## Demo Programs

### [AXM Example Programs](https://github.com/VoxelPi/AxiomAsmPrograms)

A collection of sample programs written in axm that demonstrate the capabilities of the AXIOM computing platform.

## Tools

### [AXIOM TOOLKIT](https://github.com/VoxelPi/Axiom/)

A collection of tools designed for developing on the axiom computing platform. Included are:

- `axiom assemble`, a custom assembler for the axm assembly language.
- `axiom bridge`, a bridge link for exchanging data with the computer bridge.
- `axiom emulate`, an emulator to test programs locally.

### [THEOREM](https://github.com/VoxelPi/Theorem)

A high-level programming language designed for the axiom computing platform. It extends the basic ideas of the AXM assembly language with high level language features.

### [VCAL](https://github.com/DrMadThrust/VCAL-compiler)

A language with a custom memory allocator
